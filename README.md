# PROJECT TITLE : Coffee Sales Dashboard

## INTRODUCTION
This project provides an interactive dashboard for analyzing sales of coffee of three types namely: Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica and Robusta. It utilizes excel pivot tables and pivot charts to offer dynamic insights into sales perfomance overtime and across different countries.
- By visualizing the sales of different coffee types overtime, it was easier to analyze the perfomance of each. The information helped in understanding which types of coffee were porpular and which ones needed improvement or promotion.
- The visualization made it possible to identify regions where specific types of coffee are popular and where there might be untapped market potential. In turn helped in coming up with market strategies and product offerings that could be used to reach out to different regions.
- Visualization of sales data helped identify trends and changing patterns of consumer behaviour . For example the sudden shift in consumer coffee preference.
- Another importance is the fact that stakeholders are able to recognize insights and and interpret them easily, when presented on a dashboard format. They make informed choices regarding marketing strategies, pricing, resource allocation to make data-driven decisions.
